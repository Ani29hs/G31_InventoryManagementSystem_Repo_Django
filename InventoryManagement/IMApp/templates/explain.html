    <h2>Inventory Management Techniques</h2>
    <p>Inventory management techniques help businesses efficiently track, store, and replenish stock while minimizing costs and avoiding shortages or overstocking. Common techniques include Just-in-Time (JIT), which reduces storage costs by ordering stock only when needed, and ABC Analysis, which categorizes inventory based on value and priority. FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) help manage inventory flow, especially for perishable or time-sensitive goods. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) determines the optimal order quantity to minimize costs.</p>
